## Dashboard
### Page Header
![Main user dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)<br/>
The dashboard is the main interface for users. It is possible to have multiple dashboards assigned to different types of users. However, all dashboards will have some common elements.
#### Main menu
The Main menu is the ribbon across the top of the dashboard. 
1. DHS Learning logo <br/>This logo text is identical to the DHS Learning text on the login screen. However, it is paired with a svg. Just pointing out the inconsistancy.<br/>The DHS Learning logo is used as a link. Therefor, it needs an active state and a hover/focus state.
2. Menu items (Transcript, Team, Find Learning, Reports, HR Programs, My Calendar, Need Help?)<br/>  These elements can have submenus attached. None of them do in our current implementation. They function as links and so need two states, active and hover/focus.
3. Gear menu (Admin Settings)<br/>![Expanded gear menu](assets/expandedGearMenu.png)<br/>
    1. The button for the gear menu has three states
        1. active - normally shown
        2. hover/focus - shown when the user hovers the cursor over it or when a user tabs to the button
        3. pressed - shown when the expanded menu is open
    2. The expanded menu has a search window

        2. hover/focus - shown when the user hovers the cursor over it or when a user tabs to the button
    4. The Message element is also functionally a link

    5. The footer of the panel contains one link, the See all link.
5. Notifications button<br/>I didn't include an image of the notifications panel expanded because it is very similar to the messages panel.<br/>
    1. The button for the notification panel has three states

        2. User image (optional)
        3. Action indicator
    2. It behaves as a button so should have three states
        1. Active
